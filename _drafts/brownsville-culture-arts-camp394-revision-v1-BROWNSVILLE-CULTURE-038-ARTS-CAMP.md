<b>BROWNSVILLE CULTURE &amp; ARTS CAMP</b>

Historic Brownsville Community, Inc. (HBC) and Pensacola Habitat for Humanity are collaborating to provide a six-week “Brownsville Culture &amp; Arts Camp” that will offer children from 4<sup>th</sup> to 7<sup>th</sup> grade who live in Brownsville the opportunity to explore their unique place in the context of their community. Funding for the camp is made possible by an award from a Rotary Club of Pensacola Community Grant in 2016.

<b>About the Camp</b>

The camp will provide a supportive environment for the children to comprehend and appreciate the history, culture and environment of Brownsville – with local educators, speakers, and artists contributing to the curriculum and facilitation of each week’s theme. The end result will be a book, “We are Brownsville,” edited by Robin Reshard, longtime Brownsville resident and creative director at her business, Robert Robino Productions. Along with facts about Brownsville, the book will include stories and drawings from the children who attend the Culture &amp; Arts Camp.

The camp will be held from 10:00 a.m. to 1:00 p.m., which includes lunch, beginning on Saturday, April 29, 2017 and ending on Saturday, June 3, 2017. The location of the camp is Pace Temple Church, 2912 West Gadsden Street, Pensacola, FL, 32505. Following is a list of the themes for the six-week camp:

Week 1 (4/29/17): Introduction/Get to know one Another/Build a “Lego® Brownsville”

Week 2 (5/6/17): Brownsville History

Week 3 (5/13/17): Biography (Brownsville Residents/Childrens’ Autobiographies)

Week 4 (5/20/17): Brownsville Culture

<a name="_GoBack"></a> Week 5 (5/27/17): Brownsville Environment

Week 6 (6/3/17): Wrap-Up Day/Children tell favorite story/Party

<b>Enrollment for Camp</b>

The camp is free of charge, but will be <b>limited to 30 students</b> who <b>MUST</b> live in Brownsville. Selection of students is based somewhat on first come, first served; however, the enrollment form also includes the requirement for the applicant to write a statement as to why they want to take the course, as well as sign a pledge, along with a parent, that they will attend all six weeks of the camp. The statement and pledges also factor into who is selected for the camp.

<b>Volunteers Needed</b>

HBC and Pensacola Habitat welcome volunteers who are interested in working on one or more of the camp “theme” days. We are still looking for Directors/Coordinators for Week 1 and Week 6 - who develop the outline or framework plan for the theme day, prepare a list for materials, find speakers if applicable, etc. We need volunteers who will assist the Directors/Coordinators for Weeks 2-5 in planning their theme days and, finally, we need volunteers who can assist with the activities on one or more of the individual camp days throughout the program.
