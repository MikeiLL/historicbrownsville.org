<p>The totals are in from the Brownsville (North)  Neighborhood Cleanup which took place on 7/19/2017.</p>

<p>The neighborhood cleanup removed tons of debris from the area. The residents took advantage of the neighborhood cleanup by placing large amounts of yard trash, bulk waste, tires, and household hazardous waste on the curb for pickup.</p>

<p>The total weight of debris collected and disposed of was 105.49 Tons which is 210,980 Pounds!</p>

<p>Thank you Nick Jordan and CRA!</p>
