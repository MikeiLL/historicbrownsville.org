On Tuesday Sept 20th Mike Kilmer met with David Wheeler (Facilities Management Director), George, Bush and Burke Page who are also with Facilities Management, Chuck Walthall who is the acoustical and audio consultant, and Carter Quina and Jane Merrit from Quina Grundhoefer Architects.

We had a tour of the (as yet to be officially named) Brownsville Community Resource Center and here are some rough notes:

Community Center Coordinators Leroy Williams and/or Shurlitha Jones will be managing the building. David Wheeler had been under the impression that it would be both of them, but Tonya Gant has “no definite answers as it relates to staff at this time”.

As far as the sound system, the speakers and power amplifiers that are in the facility now will be repaired where necessary and retained. The mixing console will be replaced with a digital console and Larry Treble Sound are in charge of installation of the components. Derek Steranke from Main Stage will be installing a digital lighting system.

From my perspective (based on the estimations of Chuck Waltham), as a performing arts venue, the center — if not world class — will be quite adequate to host events theatrical and musical events at all volumes with audiences as little as fifty people up to a thousand if not more. Carter Quina said that by square footage capacity in the auditorium will be 1,600 people.

Stage will be extended to about 15 feet deep (my estimation), with Luxury Vinyl laid over the top. It’s a flexible enough surface that I think it will be comfortable for dance. There will be a large “green room” from which the stage will be able to be accessed from both Stage Left and Stage Right. The stage will also be handicapped accessible, as will the mezzanine. The front of the stage will also have some steps built into the design so that it can easily be ascended and descended from and to the house (graduation ceremonies, speakers entering audience area).

Ceiling tiles are being replaced with new tiles that have an increased Noise Reduction Coefficient of .7 compared to the previous NRC of .65. A higher NRC was considered, but would have meant tiles that were less resistant to being broken on impact (basketballs, etc). In order to prevent tiles being knocked out of place by balls, they will each be clipped into place.

Lighting in the auditorium is being replaced with LED’s so that a lift does not have to be rented as often to replace the bulbs. 

Most of the stained glass will be retained except those with a strongly religious overtone, which will be replaced with frosted white glass. There is a cross in the stained glass in the front facade which will be obfuscated by the sign identifying the center.

County and Architects are looking for community input on what the center should be named, and are open to input on colors for repainting.

Modular carpet squares will match the Zola Tone paint on the walls. Use of modular carpet is so that repairs can be done simply by replacing specific damaged sections.

Main entrance when there isn’t an event taking place in the auditorium will be through a North facing door, after which there will be a reception desk. A glass wall is being built separating a small room potentially designated for fitness equipment and upstairs, two rooms will have a soundproof window between them to facilitate an audio/multimedia recording facility.

Tables and chairs will likely be stored underneath the mezzanine when not in use, but the aim is to purchase caddies for them which can be moved in the elevator. There a few small to medium sized rooms designated for storage.
