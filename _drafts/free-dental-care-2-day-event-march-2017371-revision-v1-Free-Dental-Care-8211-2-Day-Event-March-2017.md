Oral health is inseparable from general health and can affect a person’s self-esteem, compromise their ability to work, attend school and lead a normal life. Unfortunately, too many Americans lack access to preventive dental care due to factors such as income, education and having health insurance. 
 
The Florida Mission of Mercy (FLA-MOM) is a two day clinic which provides free dental care to the underserved and uninsured in Florida – those that would otherwise go without dental care. The Florida Mission of Mercy is a first-come, first-serve event with a goal of treating 2,000 patients in two days. Every year, the Florida Mission of Mercy project is held in a different locations throughout the state.
 
This year this free clinic is being held in Pensacola. Preference is being given to veterans and it is recommended that all who wish to be seen arrive early, as typically hundreds of people have to be turned away.
Clinic dates: Friday, March 24, 2017 and Saturday March 25, 2017 (no times currently listed)
