*CRA PAINT PROGRAM (funded with TIF funds): The CRA offers an exterior painting program in CRAs for income eligible property owners—just for a homestead residence. The contact for that program is Glenn Griffith 595-3538

*CRA RESIDENTIAL REHAB PROGRAM (TIF funded): The CRA also offers the residential rehab program in CRAs. This is the matching grant for up to $6K for specific types of repairs (i.e., roof, HVAC, etc), but there is no income limit and it can be used for investment properties as well as owner-occupants. The Brownsville contact is Sherry Duffey 595-1673.

*<a href="http://myescambia.com/our-services/neighborhood-human-services/neighborhood-enterprise/homeowner-repair-programs">NED CDBG/SHIP REHAB PROGRAMS</a>: Our office offers multiple rehab programs for income eligible owner occupants in incorporated Escambia County (no City residents) utilizing federal CDBG and state SHIP funding. The main focus of our programs is not necessarily cosmetics, but rather code, health and safety issues. We will prioritize items to repair the home to get it to a safe and sanitary state; we will often paint while we are there, but that is not the main focus of our program. Unfortunately, due to our wait list and funding, we are only taking applications from owners needing to connect to sewer (brochure attached) or if referred from Environmental Enforcement or the Health Department due to a code citation.

*<a href="http://myescambia.com/our-services/neighborhood-human-services/neighborhood-enterprise/demolition-assistance-program">NED CDBG DEMO/CLEARANCE PROGRAM</a>: Our office also offers a demolition/clearance assistance program for income eligible owners (info/referral form attached) that have received a Notice of Violation from Code enforcement and need help with demolition of structures and/or overgrowth on their property. It does not have to be a homestead property, but the owner needs to live in Escambia County. We are almost out of funding for this fiscal year due to high demand for this activity.

*<a href="https://myescambia.com/our-services/neighborhood-human-services/community-redevelopment-agencies/programs-and-services/residential-programs/residential-hazardous-tree-program">Residential Hazardous Tree Program</a>: The Community Redevelopment Agency’s Residential Hazardous Tree Program provides tree trimming and/or removal services to income qualifying homeowners located within Escambia County’s designated redevelopment districts. The tree or limb must present a danger to the homeowners’ or neighbor’s primary residence and show obvious signs of rot or damage. Funding is based on availability and will be provided on a first come, first served basis. All services provided under this program will be conducted by a licensed and insured contractor provided by the CRA. Funding for this program is provided by Tax Incremental Financing.
