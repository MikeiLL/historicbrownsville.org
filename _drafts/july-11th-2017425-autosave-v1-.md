6:05 p.m. – General Membership Meeting Called to Order
(Note: Peggy Fowler was asked to take the minutes since the Board Secretary is out of town)

Opening Prayer:  Evon Horton

Board Members in Attendance: Mike Kilmer, Robin Reshard, Keri Hankins, Jeremy Craft, Gladys Philyaw, James Welcome, Dennis McReynolds

Number of Eligible Members in Attendance: 20

General Meeting Minutes: Minutes from the June 2017 General Meeting were not available so they were not approved.  
Treasurer’s Report: Robin Reshard distributed the Treasurer’s report for June 1-June 30, 2017. As of June 30 there were 29 members. Receipts of dues/donations of $200 were deposited in June with no expenditures, culminating in a balance of $434.79 in the combined savings and checking account for the association.  Jeremy Craft made a motion to approve the Treasurer’s Report; Bob Tucker seconded the motion; and it was approved unanimously.
Old Business
Update on the Mobile Highway Corridor Management Plan:  Mike Kilmer explained that June 12 was the last day to get the “road diet” option into the Transportation Planning Organization (TPO) Long Range Plan for 2020.  He said that he was going to attend the meeting on June 12 at Sanders Beach and asked anyone who felt they could go to the meeting to attend and voice support for the project.  The more people who support the project, the more chance the project has of being prioritized higher on the 2020 list of long range projects.  Also, people can send emails to members of the TPO, who are City Council members and County Commissioners. 
Governance Committee Recommendations for Bylaws Amendments: Jeremy Craft distributed a copy of the proposed bylaw amendments, which had been emailed to all members 10 days in advance.  When he first started discussing the amendments, there was not a voting quorum of members in attendance and the question was asked that if time was becoming an issue (since Resource Center staff had to stay overtime for the HBC meeting) would it be possible to discuss and vote on only one item from the proposed amendments.  It was established that voting on one item would be acceptable; and since some members wanted to discuss other issues they were agreeable to discuss only the quorum issue at this meeting, if a quorum was in attendance, and wait until the next meeting to discuss other amendments.
Jeremy Craft made a motion to take the amendments to the bylaws off the table; Carlota Andrews seconded the motion; and the motion was passed unanimously.  
Discussion was held as to whether it would be better to establish a certain number of members as a quorum of the membership or to establish a percentage of members as a quorum (i.e., 33% of the membership must be in attendance in order to establish a quorum or 10 members must be in attendance to establish a quorum).  Some benefits and concerns were expressed about each method.  Meanwhile, more members came to the meeting and a quorum of 20 was established.  A motion was made to call the vote, it was seconded and approved unanimously.  
Jeremy Craft made a motion to amend Section 7.2.E of the Bylaws as recommended by the Governance Committee.  James Welcome seconded the motion.  All but one member present (Robin Reshard) approved the motion.
Closing Prayer - Jeremy Craft
Jeremy Craft made a motion to adjourn the meeting; James Welcome seconded the motion; motion was approved unanimously.
7:16 p.m. – General Membership Meeting was adjourned
