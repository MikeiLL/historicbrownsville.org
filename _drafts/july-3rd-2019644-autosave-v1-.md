## TREASURERS REPORT
 * Postponed

## OLD BUSINESS

__Update on Cervantes/Mobile Highway Corridor__ –  Sherry Duffy explained that there are two workshops meetings scheduled on July 16th from 5:30 - 7PM at the Brownsville Community Center and on August 13th from 2 - 4PM at the Fricker Center, the purpose of which are to get community input on the Hwy 90 Pedestrian Safety Project, publicized at MyCervantes. She continued to suggest the the subsequent presentation by Bonita Player and Cory Wilkinson would offer more details.

__Slowfest - October 5__.  Slowfest has hired a Festival Manager and engaged a new Chairperson, who also subsequently had to resign due to unexpected family complications. The idea of adopting the Sloth as a mascot and perhaps reaching out to the [Sloth Appreciation Society](http://www.slothville.com/join-sloth-appreciation-society/) for some type of partnership and/or endorsement was suggested.

## NEW BUSINESS

__Baptist Hospital Moving__ – Evon Horton, having attended the recent Baptist Hospital community meeting, reported on the organizations plans to relocate their hospital to Brent Lane near the i110 interstate overpass. This could leave Brownsville without a nearby Emergency Room–a significant healthcare facility, and primary for many of our residents. Dr. Horton reported that the Baptist Organization, though there were gaps in some of the information presented at their meeting, are dedicated to the neighborhood and looking for further input from us as they make plans going forward. Baptist is the 2nd largest employer, Horton reports, with 3,000 employees. They own 75 acres of property on and around E Street and definitely plan to keep offices open at that location. Their president and CEO, Mark Faulkner and outreach/marketing coordinator, Jennifer were both at the meeting Dr. Horton attended and aim to work with the community.

__Paces Senior Living Facility__ – Dr. Horton reported that the Pace Foundation have already purchased significant amounts of materials for the W Street facility. They were, apparently, unable to find a local general contractor with the necessary experience and are using a general contractor based in Alabama, but are working with Evon and Lumon May to engage local trade contractors.

__My Cervantes/Hwy 90 Pedestrian Safety presentation__ – Bonita Player, the Public Involvement Coordinator for the $7M Domingues to A Street Hwy 90 Pedestrian Safety project, along with the Engineer of Record, Cory Wilkinson, explained their process as well as the purpose of the two upcoming public workshops (noted above) in July 16th and August 13th. (Corrected by Cory Wilkinson: "I would offer is that the HDR Project Manager is Brad Collins and he is the Engineer of Record on the project.  I don’t think I mentioned that specifically in the meeting.   I’m the community planner and assisting with public involvement.")

 * It was clarified that despite some political press about a Governor’s veto, the project will go forth as planned.
 * The main Access Management workshop will occur on an as yet unspecified date in October, at which point the project plans will be at 60% completion.
 * The purpose of the workshops is to get public input, significantly on location and type of pedestrian crossings and the design of the median.
 * Lane widths will be reduced from 12’ to 10’, which tends to keep drivers at a slower pace.
 * With slower driving pace, drivers are more likely to notice businesses they are passing.
 * Median gives refuge to people crossing the street.
 * Suggestion is not to put bicycle lanes on Cervantes, but to create those on nearby parallel streets, for example Jackson Street.
 * There is also a Feasibility Study for a more significant Road Diet, which might include reducing the number of lanes and potentially purchasing right of way, reinstating some street side parking. The feasibility study studies number of cars using the facility and there should be some results back in the next few months.
 * The 30% plan has just been submitted.
 * Two options for pedestrian crossing signals (between current traffic signals) are:
   * [Rectangular Rapid Flashing Beacon](https://safety.fhwa.dot.gov/intersection/conventional/unsignalized/tech_sum/fhwasa09009) (RRFB), which FDOT is concerned might impeded traffic too much, as they are not currently able to be timed with other signals.
   * Button Triggered Red Light
 * Two new signals have been proposed at L and I streets.

Mike Kilmer asked if it would be possible to have an RRFB which was synced with other signals and would alert pedestrian as to when it would next become active following activation request.

Evon Horton made a motion, seconded by Charles McQuaid, that the President (Mike Kilmer) should compose and send an email commentary requesting the following two items:

 * Lower the speed limit along the corridor from 35MPH to 30MPH.
 * Increase the number of pedestrian crossings west of Pace Blvd from current 1 to at least 3.

The motion passed unanimously. 

Mike Kilmer asked how the decision-making process was made at FDOT following their report on public involvement and was told that Kerrie Harrell with FDOT will probably make the ultimate decision.

## Announcements
 * September HBC Meeting rescheduled to Tuesday, Sept 10th due to schedule conflict with Evon Horton and Bap
 * Free Yoga Classes at West Florida Community Health Tues and Thurs 9:00-10.00
 * Brownsville Assembly of God Farmshares for the remainder of this year:  July 27, August 24, Sept 28, Oct 19, Nov 9, Dec 14, Jan 11.
 * Sacred Heart Hospital will partner with Brownsville Assembly of God in two upcoming Farmshares.

Eric Martin made the motion to adjourn the meeting at 6:35.  Becky McQuaid seconded.
