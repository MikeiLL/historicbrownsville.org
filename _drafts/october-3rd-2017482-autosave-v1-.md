Meeting was called to order at 5:40 p.m by Board president Mike Kilmer.  Rev. Evon Horton offered an opening prayer.

Present: Mike Kilmer, Jeremy Craft, Beth Kilmer, Gladys Philyaw, Dennis McReynolds, Cheryl Anderson, Sherry Duffey, David Padgett, Evon Horton, Randy Steele, Peggy Fowler, Gloria Horning, Faith Higgins, Michael Jackson, Lumon May.

<h2>OLD BUSINESS</h2>

Mike announced that suggested bylaw changes had been approved by the required majority of the membership, and duly recorded in the existing bylaws.

Playground up-date.  Michael Rhodes of the Parks Dept has worked with HBC in formulating plans for the new playground.  It will be in the grassy, tree-lined area west of the Community Center, with a color scheme of gold (or yellow) and brown.  The County is open to input on the type of fencing around the playground - chain link is the cheapest but other choices (e.g. aluminum) would be more attractive.
i
Gateway sign.  The new sign design has been approved.  One sign will appear on Mobile Highway just west of the bridge leading into Brownsville.  A second sign is under consideration for the corner of Cervantes and W streets.

Grants review.  Under the West Cervantes Management Plan, $1.5m is allocated by the Florida Department of Transportation for minor improvements on Cervantes Street beginning at W Street.  Further improvements are not due for consideration until 2020.

One grant for $5,000 has been approved for HBC by Wells Fargo/Habitat for Humanity to use for Brownsville Business Development.  Habitat has submitted a $5,000 grant to the Cox Community Foundation to fund Community Art.

The CRA approved funds for an audit of streetlights in Brownsville as well as money for yard signs highlighting the Historic Brownsville Community, including dates of our meetings.

<h2>NEW BUSINESS</h2>

Sherry Duffey of CRA is keeping her eyes out for any mini grants that might be applicable to current needs.

Members discussed advantages that would accrue from having representation at HBC meetings from management staff of the Community Center and from the County Commission.  Lumon May stopped in later in the meeting; Mr. May expressed agreement with both suggestions.

Gloria Hornung, president of Tanyard Homeowners Association attended the meeting as an invited guest.  She shared her knowledge about housing development in the County and expressed her desire for co-operation with HBC and similar organizations for the betterment of the community.

Peggy Fowler gave a report on a recent talk in Pensacola by Charles Marhon, co-founder and president of "Strong Towns."  Pensacola activists Quint Studer and Christian Wagley were instrumental in bringing Mr. Marhon to town.  Further information about the group's perspective can be found at [www.strongtowns.org](http://www.strongtowns.org.  The following HBC members volunteered to meet periodically with Christian and others for further discussion: Mike, Peggy, Faith, Evon, Gladys, Michael Jackson, Cheryl.
