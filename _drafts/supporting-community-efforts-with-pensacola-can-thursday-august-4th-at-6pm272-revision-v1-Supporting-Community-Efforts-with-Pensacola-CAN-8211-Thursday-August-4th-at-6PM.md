What: Supporting Community Efforts with Pensacola CAN

Where: Brownsville Assembly of God, Reception Hall, 3100 W. Desoto St., Pensacola

When: Thursday August 4, 6 pm

Do you have a great idea for a project to improve Brownsville? Pensacola CAN is a nonprofit, 501(c)(3) organization offering financial and management services to grassroots groups making positive change in our community. Join us on August 4 as Pensacola CAN staff, board, and partner organizations share how local groups can be more effective by joining us as one of our partners.

Pensacola CAN assists community groups and events with administrative issues such as donor management, grant writing, and fiscal sponsorship that allows donors to make tax-deductible contributions. This allows groups to spend their time focused on what they do bestâ€”making a difference in the community. Organizations that are already in partnership with Pensacola CAN include Bike Pensacola, 350 Pensacola, and the West Florida Literary Federation.

The event is free and light refreshments will be served. For more information: 850-687-9968 or admin@pensacolacan.org
