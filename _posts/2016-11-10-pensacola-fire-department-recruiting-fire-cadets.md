Pensacola Fire Department recruiting Fire Cadets
Looking for a uniquely rewarding career? Apply to become a Pensacola Fire Department Cadet.

Have you always wanted to be a Firefighter but didn’t know where to start? The City of Pensacola is now actively recruiting candidates for Fire Cadets.

No prior emergency service training or experience is required. Individuals hired as Fire Cadets are provided with the training required to obtain Firefighter certifications through the State of Florida. This program is designed to encourage diversity while providing an emergency services career path for individuals seeking employment with the Pensacola Fire Department as certified Firefighters. 

“In the past, a lot of our new hires have been from out of town and as soon as a position opens up closer to their home, they leave,” said Pensacola City Administrator Eric Olson. “Our hope would be to hire in our own backyard,” Olson said. 

Fire Cadet applicants must be 18 years old, and have a high school diploma or equivalent. Applicants must possess a driver’s license and must have been free from the use of tobacco or tobacco products for one (1) year prior to application. The application period will close November 25, at 11:59 pm.

Fire Cadets will receive a full time hourly rate of $8.68 with insurance and benefits. In addition, cadets will also attend the Fire Academy at no cost to them and upon successful completion of the training will be eligible for a firefighter position.

Applicants can learn more by contacting Pensacola Fire Department Assistant Fire Chief Greg Redding at 436-3831. To apply, visit www.pensacolacityjobs.com beginning on Friday, November 11, at 4 pm.
