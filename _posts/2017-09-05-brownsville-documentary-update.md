<blockquote>Dominique and I shot four videos, one of them about A Flower Shop ( a video focusing on Brownsville businesses), one of the HBC Members (you and the florist), another of [Commissioner] Underhill and [Commissioner May], and our last one is of the Brownsville Center, which David from CMR and I are shooting before the end of this week.
All of these videos and documentations of the CRA’s efforts to revitalize Brownsville will be compiled into a media kit, which will be released by next week at the latest, and will be sent to several local news organizations.
I apologize for not getting to you earlier about this. I think you will like what we’ve done and that Escambia will grow more aware of what the CRA and the HBC have done for Brownsville! –Susanna Rogers</blockquote>
