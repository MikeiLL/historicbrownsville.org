<p>It's the Great American Cleanup! We are excited to #CleanYourBlock with you and your neighbors in the Brownsville Neighborhood on March 30th, 2019 beginning at 9:00am.</p>

<p>The Cleanup will begin at Brownsville Community Center (as well as Ebonwood Community Center) and we will be meeting promptly at 9:00am. Cleaning supplies including gloves, bags, trash grabbers, and buckets will be provided on a first come, first served basis.</p>

<p>All ages are welcome, but minors must be accompanied by an adult.</p>

<p>Happy cleaning, and make sure to send us your pictures and use the hashtag #CleanYourBlock when you post!</p>
