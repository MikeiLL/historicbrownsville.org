ARTICLE VII - MEETINGS</p>

<p>SECTION 7.1. MEETINGS OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS
Annual Board Meeting. The     annual meeting of the Board, for the purpose of transacting such     business as determined necessary by law, Board policies, and/or by     the agenda set by the President of the Board, shall be held during     the final quarter of the calendar year at a date and time as the     Board may determine.</p>

<p>Regular Board Meetings.     Additional regular meetings of the Board shall be held no less than     once quarterly at such dates and times as the Board may determine.</p>

<p>Special Board Meetings.     Special meetings of the Board may be called by or at the request of     the President or twenty percent (20%) of the Directors then in     office.</p>

<p>Notice of Meetings. Regular     meetings of the Board may be held without notice if the date, time     and place of the meeting have previously been fixed by the Board;     otherwise, regular meetings must be preceded by at least two (2)     days’ notice to each Director of date, time and place, but not the     purpose, of the meeting. Special meetings of the Board must be     preceded by at least two (2) days’ notice to each Director of     date, time and place, and purpose, of the meeting. Notice required     by the foregoing provisions may be given by any usual means of     communication (including, without limitation, email) and may be oral     or written.<br />
E.    Quorum and Voting. A quorum of the Board consists of over fifty percent (50%) of the Directors currently in office. For an official vote of the Board, over fifty percent (50%) of the Directors present must be Resident Members of the Association. If a Director is unable to attend a meeting in person, telephonic or video attendance may be arranged. The attendance of a Director by remote means will count towards the quorum and attendance requirements. If remote attendance becomes an impediment to the successful completion of the Board agendas or if a Director is consecutively unavailable other than by remote means, the Board may revisit this policy. If a voting quorum is present as described, the affirmative vote of a majority of the directors is the act of the Board, unless the vote of a greater number of directors is required by these Bylaws. If a voting quorum is present as described herein, the affirmative vote of a majority of Directors present is the act of the Board, unless the vote of a greater number of Directors is required by these Bylaws.</p>

<p>Conflict of Interests. All     Directors will disclose any actual or possible conflict of interest     when accepting nomination to the Board or as the conflict arises. A     conflict of interest may be defined as a duality of interest as well     as a financial conflict which conflicts with the purposes of the     Historic Brownsville Community as outlined in Article IV, Purposes     of these Bylaws of the Historic Brownsville Community. Any Director     believing they may have a conflict of interest on a particular     matter before the Board for a vote may recuse themselves from the     vote or disclose the conflict or possible conflict to the Board.     Upon the disclosure of the conflict or possible conflict, the Board     will review the matter outside of the presence of the interested     person to make a determination as to whether a conflict exists and     whether the interested person should be restricted from voting on     the matter. If a conflict of interest is determined by a majority     vote of all Directors present in person or by remote means, the     interested person will not be allowed to vote on the matter. Prior     to being reviewed by the Board, the interested person will be given     an opportunity to be heard to explain the possible conflict.     Failure to disclose a possible or actual conflict may result in     removal from the Board if a two-thirds vote of the voting quorum     determines the failure to disclose was intentional. Prior to a vote     on the failure to disclose, the interested person will be given an     opportunity to be heard on the failure to disclose. The Board may     take other non-monetary actions, to include temporary suspension, as     the Board determines appropriate action in lieu of removal. A     record of conflict of interest actions will be kept by the     Secretary. If the Secretary is unavailable because he or she is an     interested party or for other reasons, the next available officer     will keep a record of the proceedings.</p>
